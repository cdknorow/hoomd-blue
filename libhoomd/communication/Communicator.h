//! <b>Class that handles MPI communication</b>
/*! This class implements the communication algorithms that are used in parallel simulations.
 * In the communication pattern used here, every processor exchanges particle data with its
 * six next neighbors lying along the three spatial axes. The original implementation of the communication scheme is
 * described in \cite Plimpton1995.
 *
 * The communication scheme consists of three stages.
 *
 *
 * -# <b> First stage</b>: Atom migration (migrateParticles())
 * <br> Atoms that have left the current domain boundary are deleted from the current processor, exchanged with neighboring
 * processors, and particles received from neighboring processors are added to the system.
 * Atoms are exchanged only infrequently, i.e. only in those steps where the neighbor list needs to be rebuilt.
 * In all other time steps, the processor that currently owns the particle continues to update its position, even if the particle
 * has moved outside the domain boundaries. It is guaruanteed that the processor can correctly calculate the forces
 * on its particles, by maintaining a current list of so-called 'ghost particle' positions.
 *
 * -# <b> Second stage</b>: Ghost exchange (exchangeGhosts())
 * <br>A list of local ghost atoms is constructed. These are atoms that are found within a distance of \f$ r_{\mathrm{cut}} + r_{\mathrm{buff}} \f$
 * from a neighboring processor's boundary (see also NeighborList). The neighboring processors need this information in order
 * to calculate the forces on their local atoms correctly. After construction of the ghost particle list, the positions of these atoms are communicated
 * to the neighboring processors.
 *
 * -# <b> Third stage</b>: Update of ghost positions (updateGhosts())
 * <br> If it is not necessary to renew the list of ghost particles (i.e. when no particle in the global system has moved more than a
 * distance \f$ r_{\mathrm{buff}}/2 \f$), we use the current ghost particle list to update the ghost positions on the neighboring
 * processors.
 *
 * Stages \b one and \b two are performed before every neighbor list build, stage \b three is executed in all other steps (before the calculation
 * of forces).
 *
 * <b>Implementation details:</b>
 *
 * In every stage, particles are subsequently exchanged in six directions:
 *
 * -# send particles to the east, receive from the west
 * -# send particles to the west, receive from the east
 * -# send particles to the north, receive from the south
 * -# send particles to the south, receive from the north
 * -# send particles upwards, receive particles from below
 * -# send particles downwards, receive particles from above.
 *
 * After every step, particles already received from a neighbor in one of the previous steps are added
 * to the list of particles considered for sending. E.g. a particle that is migrating to the processor
 * north-east of the present one is first sent to the processor in the east. This processor then forwards it
 * to its northern neighbor.
 *
 * In stage one, by deleting particles immediately after sending, the processor that sends the particle transfers
 * ownership of the particle to its neighboring processor. In this way it is guaranteed that the decision about where
 * to send the particle to is always made by one and only one processor. This ensure that the total number of particles remains
 * constant (no particle can get lost).
 *
 * In stage two and three, ghost atoms received from a neighboring processor are always included in the local
 * ghost atom lists, and they maybe replicated to more neighboring processors by the communication pattern
 * described above.
