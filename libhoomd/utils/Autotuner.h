//! Autotuner for low level GPU kernel parameters
/*! **Overview** <br>
    Autotuner is a helper class that autotunes GPU kernel parameters (such as block size) for performance. It runs an
    internal state machine and makes sweeps over all valid parameter values. Performance is measured just for the single
    kernel in question with cudaEvent timers. A number of sweeps are combined with a median to determine the fastest
    parameter. Additional timing sweeps are performed at a defined period in order to update to changing conditions.
    The sampling mode can also be changed to average or maximum. The latter is helpful when the distribution of kernel
    runtimes is bimodal, e.g. because it depends on input of variable size.

    The begin() and end() methods must be called before and after the kernel launch to be tuned. The value of the tuned
    parameter should be set to the return value of getParam(). begin() and end() drive the state machine to choose
    parameters and insert the cuda timing events (when needed).

    Autotuning can be enabled/disabled by calling setEnabled(). A disabled Autotuner makes no more parameter sweeps,
    but continues to return the last determined optimal parameter. If an Autotuner is disabled before it finishes the
    first complete sweep through parameters, the first parameter in the list is returned and a warning is issued.
    isComplete() queries if the initial scan is complete. setPeriod() changes the period at which the autotuner performs
    new scans.

    Each Autotuner instance has a string name to help identify it's output on the notice stream.

    Autotuner is not useful in non-GPU builds. Timing is performed with CUDA events and requires ENABLE_CUDA=on.
    Behavior of Autotuner is undefined when ENABLE_CUDA=off.

    ** Implementation ** <br>
    Internally, m_nsamples is the number of samples to take (odd for median computation). m_current_sample is the
    current sample being taken in a circular fashion, and m_current_element is the index of the current parameter being
    sampled. m_samples stores the time of each sampled kernel launch, and m_sample_median stores the current median of
    each set of samples. When idle, the number of calls is counted in m_calls. m_state lists the current state in the
    state machine.
